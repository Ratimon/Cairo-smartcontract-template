# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start & Architecture

This project is a monorepo created with [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

> 🔏 See smart contracts `**.sol` in [`./contracts`](../contracts/).



>  🔏 Manage dependencies in [`hardhat.config.ts`](../hardhat.config.ts).

- it includes required config information, such as **rpc** config and **plugin dependencies**.
- It also contains **Account Config Addresses** which are stored in `namedAccounts` key. This is very useful additional hardhat plugin.

 - >  As these can be uses as parameter to run the deploy scripts in `/deploy`



> 🔏 Import built artifacts`**.json` in [`/artifacts`](../artifacts/)

- it contains **ABI files**.
- > The ABI, **Application Binary Interface**, is basically how you call functions in a contract and get data back.
> 
- To generate these , compile the contracts via runing:
> 
 ```
 yarn hardhat compile
 ````


> 🔏 See deployment scripts `**.ts` in [`./deploy`](../deploy/).

-  They can be used to both for TDD purpose and deployment in production
- >   Read more [`here`](./3_DEPLOY_SCRIPT.md).



> 🔏 See deployment History `**.json` in [`./deployments`](../deployments/).
- They contain both **ABI** and **Deployed Addresses** .
- This is only generated for Testnet and Mainnet after running **deployment scripts**d.


> 🔏 See customed tasks `**.ts` in [`./tasks`](../tasks/).

- They are core components used for automation 
- Note that all tasks including built-in ones can be shown by runing:
> 
 ```
 yarn hardhat help
 ````


> 🔏 See test suites `**.test.ts` in [`./test`](../test/).

-  Test suites are locally performed after automatically running all the deployments scripts in [`./deploy`](../deploy/).
- > This will generaly speed up the tests as further tests will be able to revert back to the full deployment, by **deployments.fixture** feature.

- Read more [`here`](./3_DEPLOY_SCRIPT.md).



> 🔏 See **Typescript Declaration Files** `**.d.ts` in [`./typechain`](../typechain/).

- They are built, so they could be used to abstract logic if wanted
