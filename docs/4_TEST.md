# ðŸŽ² Debugging using TDD


### ðŸ§ª  Command

- One using hardhat that can leverage hardhat-deploy to reuse deployment procedures and named accounts:

```bash
yarn test
```
```bash
yarn fork:test <network> [--blockNumber <blockNumber>] [mocha args...]
```
Note that , for binance smart chain we use **network** name as `bscmainnetfork`

```bash
yarn fork:test bscmainnetfork [--blockNumber <blockNumber>] 
```

This will test the contract against a temporary fork of the specified network.
<br/><br/>

These will execute your tests using mocha. you can pass extra arguments to mocha
<br/><br/>

```bash
yarn coverage
```

These will produce a coverage report in the `coverage/` folder
<br/><br/>

```bash
yarn gas
```

These will produce a gas report for function used in the tests
<br/><br/>


### ðŸ§ª Tips


It is recommended to run unit and isolation tests in isolation by simply using `.skip()`

```typescript
describe.skip()
```

To utilize the maximum benefit of debugging features, use:

```
yarn hardhat test --logs
```

> :warning: **Warning**
>

> we can add the --logs after your test command. So, this could emit Event during TDD environment
