# 2. üíº Deploy Scripts

## üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

All **deployment scripts** are written in `/deploy` folder


We speify **The network** to deploy the smart contract with  **--network** as parameter. The config is shown in `hardhat.config.ts`

```
--network hardhat
--network bsctestnet
--network bscmainnet
```

All artifacts will be stored in `/Deployments` folder but it stores only recently deployed one. 

There is sometimes downtime for rpc. So, rpc need to be changed in `hardhat.config.ts`, and alternatives can be found at
[docs.binance.org](https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/developer/rpc.html)


```typescript
    bscTestnet: {
      // url: "https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/",
      url: "https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s2.binance.org:8545/",
      chainId: 97,
      gasPrice: 20000000000,
      // accounts: [`0x${PRIVATE_KEY}`]
      accounts: {
        count: 10,
        initialIndex: 0,
        mnemonic: `${MNEMONIC}`,
        path: "m/44'/60'/0'/0",
      }

    },
```

In each script, relevant **tags** are specified so we can use **--tags** as parameter

```typescript
func.tags = ['tokens'];
```

In this way, we can run specified set of scripts or skip unwanted ones

Each of single script must be **atomic**, so **dependencies** can be specified to make the script being running in order:

```typescript
  func.dependencies = ['tokens']
```
> :warning: **Warning**
>

> After each step, **hardhat.config.ts** needs to be updated regarding to newly  deployed accounts.
>
>We can searh through terminal command with keyword  `key`  or `We may update these following addresses at hardhatconfig.ts`


## üèó Commands

```bash
yarn void:deploy
```

This will deploy your contracts on the in-memory hardhat network and exit, leaving no trace. quick way to ensure deployments work as intended without consequences
<br/><br/>

`yarn fork:execute <network> [--blockNumber <blockNumber>] [--deploy] <file.ts> [args...]`

This will execute the script `<file.ts>` against a temporary fork of the specified network

if `--deploy` is used, deploy scripts will be executed
<br/><br/>

```bash
yarn fork:deploy <network> [--blockNumber <blockNumber>] [args...]
```

This will deploy the contract against a temporary fork of the specified network.

Note that , for binance smart chain we use **network** name as `bscmainnetfork`

```bash
yarn fork:test bscmainnetfork [--blockNumber <blockNumber>] 
```

Behind the scene it uses `hardhat deploy` command so you can append any argument for it
<br/><br/>

```bash
yarn fork:dev <network> [--blockNumber <blockNumber>] [args...]
```

This will deploy the contract against a fork of the specified network and it will keep running as a node.

Behind the scene it uses `hardhat node` command so you can append any argument for it
